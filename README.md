# Scrabble

Project Overview:

This project, completed from October 2018 to December 2018, is an online version of the popular word game, Scrabble, developed using Java, Applets, and Swings. In this implementation, players can create words from jumbled alphabets, following the rules of Scrabble. To enhance the gameplay experience, we have implemented a point system where points are allocated based on the validity of words according to a dictionary.

Key Features:

Scrabble Gameplay: Our implementation faithfully recreates the classic Scrabble experience, allowing players to create words by placing letter tiles on a game board.

Java Technology: The game is built using Java, Applets, and Swings, making it accessible and playable on a wide range of devices.

Point System: To add an element of competition and strategy, we have implemented a point system that rewards players for creating valid words.

How to Play:

Launch the Game: Run the Scrabble application on your device.

Create Words: Start creating words from the provided jumbled alphabets. Place the letter tiles on the game board following the Scrabble rules.

Score Points: As you form valid words, the game will allocate points based on the dictionary's word validity.

Challenge Friends: Challenge your friends or play against the computer to test your Scrabble skills.
